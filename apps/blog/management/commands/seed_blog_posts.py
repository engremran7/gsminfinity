<h2>Android Partition Basics</h2>
<p>Android devices use multiple partitions to organize system components and user data. Understanding this layout is essential for firmware work.</p>

<h3>Critical Partitions</h3>

<h4>Boot Partition</h4>
<p>Contains the kernel and ramdisk. Essential for device startup. Corruption here causes boot failures.</p>

<h4>System Partition</h4>
<p>Holds the Android operating system, framework, and pre-installed apps. On A/B devices, there are system_a and system_b partitions.</p>

<h4>Vendor Partition</h4>
<p>Contains device-specific HAL implementations and drivers. Introduced with Project Treble for better modularity.</p>

<h4>Userdata Partition</h4>
<p>Stores user-installed apps, settings, and personal data. Encrypted on modern devices.</p>

<h4>Recovery Partition</h4>
<p>Contains the recovery system for maintenance operations. Custom recoveries like TWRP replace this partition.</p>

<h3>Other Important Partitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EFS:</strong> Stores IMEI, MAC addresses, and calibration data</li>
<li><strong>Modem:</strong> Baseband firmware for cellular connectivity</li>
<li><strong>Cache:</strong> Temporary files and OTA updates</li>
<li><strong>Persist:</strong> Sensor calibration and factory data</li>
